yacpi - Yet Another Configuration and Power Interface

== Introduction ==
yacpi gathers information provided by the libacpi and displays them
in a user-friendly ncurses interface or in normal text mode.
It will display information about batteries, fans, thermal zones, ac status
and some information about cpu.

== Dependencies ==
yacpi depends on the following libraries:

- libacpi : http://www.ngolde.de/libacpi.html
- ncurses5: www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/
- libc6

== Installation ==
Compiling and installing yacpi is pretty straight forward:
make
make install

== Contact ==
Nico Golde <nico@ngolde.de>

== Donation ==
If you want to donate money or hardware (precedented) to support libacpi
development, because it would make testing more easy if I would have the hardware,
please also use this address to contact me.

== License ==
yacpi is licensed under version 2 of the GPL, see COPYING file for
license details.
